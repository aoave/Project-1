# Project Feedback + Evaluation

## Project Workflow

>Did you complete the user stories, wireframes, task tracking, and/or ERDs, as specified above? Did you use source control as expected for the phase of the program youâ€™re in (detailed above)?

**Meets Expectations**. Your project is very clearly scoped though your user
stories could use some improvement. They should be formatted "As a blank, I want
to blank, so I can blank". E.g. "As a user, I want to flip cards over, so I can
find matches". "As a user, I want to see cards I've matched so I can avoid
flipping them over again."

In the future, it would be nice to see evidence of your planning process, like a trello board with current, backlog, and icebox user stories.

## Technical Requirements

>Did you deliver a project that met all the technical requirements? Given what the class has covered so far, did you build something that was reasonably complex?

**Meets Expectations**. I liked your design, and the game meets the technical
/ feature requirements. I liked your addition of sounds as well!

## Code Quality

>Did you follow code style guidance and best practices covered in class, such as spacing, modularity, and semantic naming? Did you comment your code as your instructors have in class?

**Meets Expectations**. In some ways, your code is great (i.e. well indented,
good variable names, etc.). That said, there are a number of ways to improve:

* overall, try to keep things neater. e.g. why two copies of the playSound
library, which isn't even used?
* make sure your HTML / CSS validates (see my comments, there are some syntax
  errors in your HTML / CSS)
* Try to simplify your code and use more methods where possible to prevent a
  method from going over 10 lines long.

## Problem Solving

>Are you able to defend why you implemented your solution in a certain way? Can you demonstrate that you thought through alternative implementations?

**Meets Expectations**. We can talk more about this in person, for P1 it's
hard to give a meaningful score here. My main feedback would be to make sure
you're not using tutorials to build WDI projects, at least not without taking
the approach I outlined of moving the tutorial version aside, and re-building
from memory.
